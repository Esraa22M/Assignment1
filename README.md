here the three classical  ciphers 
  1- AFFine cipher  you can find its encrayption and decryption 
  2- shift cipher you can find its encrayption and decryption
  3- vigenere-cipher you can find its encrayption and decryption
  4 - you have to run using cmd  and especify the paramters 
  5 - create the input file and put the plaintext in it
     and you will get the cipher text in a file called output.txt
     


when you run the code write  1.py  followed  by [s or a or v] which represent cipher type  followed by [e or d] which especify the
type of operation [encryption or decryption] followed by the file which contain the plaine text followed by the name of output file
then  the key
the key is single number in case of shift cipher
 and 2 values in case of AFFine cipher 
 and string in case of vigenere-cipher
